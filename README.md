# Users Privacy Protector
Problem -> When we visit a website there are certain terms and conditions it has, most of the users most of the time without even reading them just Accept or Reject it but this is not a good practice.

Solution -> This project solve the problem by summerizing the main points of their T&C for the user so that the user can decide to Accept or Reject on that basis

Project Features:
1. Web scraping of terms and conditions just by giving the URL
2. Has rotating proxy so that one server cannot be blocked
3. Chatbot -> User can chat with the system to know more about a Terms and Conditions
4. Uses RAG for accurate result generation for chatbot
5. Leverages Groq API's Fast AI Inference

Technologies used:
1. Web Scraping (Beautiful Soup)
2. Interface (Streamlit)
3. LLM Genearation (Groq API)
4. Databases (ChromaDB)
