<p>This agreement is between you or the entity you represent and Microsoft Corporation, and consists of the terms below, Exhibit A, terms incorporated by reference, terms applicable to other Microsoft web sites and services that you use and are necessary to use the Services (for example, your Microsoft Account), Microsoft API Terms, and the Privacy Statement (together, the âAgreementâ). If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of an entity, such as your employer, you represent that you have the legal authority to bind that entity. If you specify a company name in connection with signing up for or ordering a Service, you will be deemed to have placed that order and to have entered into this Agreement on behalf of that organization or company. Key terms are defined in Section 11. By accepting this Agreement, you agree to these terms. If you do not accept and comply with this Agreement, you may not use the Services.</p>
<h4 id="1-services">1. Services.</h4>
<p>a.	<strong>Right to use.</strong> We grant you the right to access and use the Services in accordance with this Agreement to design, develop, and test your applications to make them available for your Microsoft 365 online services, on-premises deployments or for the Microsoft In-product Store and/or AppSource. You may not use the Services for production use.</p>
<p>b.	<strong>User Plan.</strong> Each user of the Microsoft 365 Developer portion of the Developer Services must be allocated an individual User Plan, whether they access the service directly or indirectly. You are entitled to <strong>one</strong> free subscription to Microsoft 365 Developer under this Agreement.</p>
<p>c.	<strong>Manner of use.</strong> You may not:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>i.	reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or work around technical limitations in the Services, except to the extent that applicable law permits it despite these limitations;</p>
</li>
<li><p>ii.	disable, tamper with or otherwise attempt to circumvent any mechanism that limits your use of the Services;</p>
</li>
<li><p>iii. rent, lease, lend, resell, transfer, or sublicense any Services or portion thereof to or for third parties, except as explicitly permitted herein or in license terms that accompany any Services component;</p>
</li>
<li><p>iv.	use the Services for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by this Agreement; or</p>
</li>
<li><p>v.	use the Services in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair any Microsoft service, or the network(s) connected to any Microsoft service, or interfere with any other partyâs use and enjoyment of any Services.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>d.	<strong>Updates.</strong> We may make changes to the Services from time to time, including: the availability of features; how long, how much or how often any given feature may be used; and feature dependencies upon other services or software.</p>
<p>e.	<strong>Preview features.</strong> We may make features available on a Preview basis. Previews are provided âAS-ISâ. Previews may be subject to reduced or different security, compliance, privacy, availability, reliability, and support commitments, as further explained in the Privacy Statement, and any additional notices provided with the Preview. We may change or discontinue Previews at any time without notice. We also may choose not to release a Preview into âGeneral Availabilityâ.</p>
<h4 id="2-software">2. Software.</h4>
<p>a.	<strong>Using Microsoft Software outside the Service.</strong> Microsoft may provide you with Microsoft Software through or as a part of the Developer Services. Termination of use of or access to the Developer Services or the termination of this Agreement terminates your right to possess or use any such Microsoft Software; and the suspension or termination of a User Plan terminates that userâs right to possess or use any such Microsoft Software that was acquired through, is attached to, or otherwise requires that User Plan. You must delete all copies of such Microsoft Software licensed under this Agreement and destroy any associated media upon the termination of the associated possession or usage rights. Microsoft may provide you with Microsoft Software for use outside the Developer Services and with (1) the Developer Services or (2) programs you develop using the Developer Services. If the Microsoft Software is provided with its own license terms, those license terms control provided that they are modified by the preceding portion of this Section 2(a) in case of conflict. If the Microsoft Software does not have its own license terms, then you may install and use any number of copies of the Microsoft Software to design, develop, and test your applications. This subsection does not apply to Microsoft Software addressed in subsection (b) below.</p>
<p>b.	<strong>Software on Documentation Portal.</strong> Software accessible on the Documentation Portal is made available by the designated publisher under the associated license terms. If Microsoft Software is accessible on the Documentation Portal without license terms, then subject to subsection (c) below you may use it to design, develop, and test your applications. If any such Microsoft Software without license terms is marked as âsampleâ or âexample,â then you may use it under the terms of the MIT License.</p>
<p>c.	<strong>Scope of rights.</strong> All Microsoft Software are the copyrighted works of Microsoft or its suppliers. All Microsoft Software are licensed not sold and may not be transferred unless specified otherwise in any license terms provided with the Microsoft Software. Rights to access Microsoft Software on any device do not give you any right to implement Microsoft patents or other Microsoft intellectual property in software or devices that access that device.</p>

This restriction does not apply to any information that is or becomes publicly available without a breach of this restriction, was lawfully known to the receiver of the information without an obligation to keep it confidential, is received from another source who can disclose it lawfully and without an obligation to keep it confidential, or is independently developed. You may disclose this confidential information if required to comply with a court order or other government demand that has the force of law. Before doing so, you must seek the highest level of protection available and, when possible, give us enough prior notice to provide a reasonable chance to seek a protective order.</p>

<p>b.	<strong>Regulatory.</strong> In any country where any current or future government regulation or requirement that applies to us, but not generally to businesses operating there, presents a hardship to us operating the Services without change, and/or causes us to believe this Agreement or the Services may be in conflict with any such regulation or requirement, we may change the Services or terminate the Agreement. Your sole remedy for such changes to the Services under this Section is to terminate this Agreement.</p>
<p>c.	<strong>Suspension or Termination.</strong> We may suspend or terminate your use of the Services if: (1) reasonably needed to prevent unauthorized access to Customer Data; (2) you fail to respond to a claim of alleged infringement under Sections 4.k or 8 within a reasonable time; (3) you violate this Agreement; or (4) we suspect fraud. We will attempt to suspend access to the minimum necessary part of the Services while the condition or need exists. We will give notice before we suspend, except where we reasonably believe we need to suspend or terminate immediately. If you do not fully address the reasons for the suspension within 60 days after we suspend, we may terminate this Agreement and delete your Customer Data without any retention period. We may also terminate your account if your use of the Developer Services is suspended more than twice in any 12-month period.</p>

We will provide you with notice prior to any suspension or termination of your subscription and Customer Data deletion.</p>
